# Zachtronics Solitaire Solvers
Solvers for various games in the Zachtronics Solitaire Collection (great game(s) btw).

## Why

As an excuse to write more code - specically using languages or tools I might not normally. Also I want to 100% the collection and this (might) make that easier to do.

## Games

- Cribbage Solitaire
  - **A score-based solitaire variant using modified Cribbage rules and an actual Cold War aircraft recognition deck**
  - Solver was originally built as an opportunity to use Rust, and specifically to have interop between Rust/C++
